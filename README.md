This project utilizes SAR data from Copernicus Sentinel-1 via Google Earth Engine for environmental monitoring.

Abstract:
These project focuses on harnessing synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data from the Copernicus Sentinel-1 mission for environmental monitoring and analysis. Leveraging the Google Earth Engine platform, the project aims to acquire, preprocess, and analyze SAR imagery to detect changes in land cover, monitor vegetation dynamics, and assess environmental trends. Machine learning algorithms, including random forests and support vector machines, will be utilized to develop predictive models for anticipating environmental changes based on historical SAR data. Interactive visualizations generated with tools like Matplotlib and Geemap will facilitate the interpretation of SAR imagery and analytical results. The project seeks to provide decision-makers with actionable insights to support resource management, disaster preparedness, and climate resilience initiatives. Additionally, efforts will be made to disseminate knowledge, build capacity, and foster collaboration to promote the adoption of SAR data analysis techniques in environmental science and policy-making

Keywords: Geemap, SAR, Google Earth Engine, Time Series.
